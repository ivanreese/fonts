# Fonts

This is a TS port of an old chunk of CoffeeScript code I've been using in various SSGs and the like for a bunch of years now.

Since I usually use it in the context of TTF and OTF fonts that I don't have permission to redistribute, I've never actually ended up putting the script up on GitHub. So, well, here it is.

I haven't tested it in this form, and I'm aware of at least one typo in the code. Exercise for the reader.
